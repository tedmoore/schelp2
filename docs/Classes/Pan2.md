## Description

Two channel equal power panner. Pan2 takes the square root of the linear scaling factor going from 1 (left or right) to 0.5.sqrt (~=0.707) in the center, which is about 3dB reduction. With linear panning (LinPan2) the signal is lowered as it approaches center using a straight line from 1 (left or right) to 0.5 (center) for a 6dB reduction in the middle. A problem inherent to linear panning is that the perceived volume of the signal drops in the middle. Pan2 solves this.


## Class Methods


### `ar`, `kr`
**Arguments:**

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `in` | The input signal. |  
| `pos` | Pan position, -1 is left, +1 is right. |  
| `level` | A control rate level input. |  

## Examples


```
// hear the difference, LinPan having a slight drop in the middle...
{ LinPan2.ar(SinOsc.ar(440), Line.kr(-1, 1, 5)) }.play

// ... whereas Pan2 is more smooth
{ Pan2.ar(SinOsc.ar(440), Line.kr(-1, 1, 5)) }.play

// other examples
{ Pan2.ar(PinkNoise.ar(0.4), FSinOsc.kr(2), 0.3) }.play;
```
